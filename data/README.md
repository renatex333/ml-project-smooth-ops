# Data Folder

Inside this folder you will find the data used for the ML Project.

## Files

1. predictions.csv : Output for predictions, in comparison to actual values
2. winequality-predict.csv : Predict split of original dataset.
3. winequality-red.csv : Original dataset.
4. winequality-train.csv : Train split of original dataset.

## Dataset Content

Inside the .csv files, you will find columns relating to variables that will determine wine quality outcome. The input variables, that being, the variables that are used to make predictions on wine quality, are as follows:

1. fixed acidity
2. volatile acidity
3. citric acid
4. residual sugar
5. chlorides
6. free sulfur dioxide
7. total sulfur dioxide
8. density
9. pH
10. sulphates
11. alcohol

Furthermore, the ouptut variable (based on sensory data) in the dataset is called 'quality', that being the last column in the csv files.
