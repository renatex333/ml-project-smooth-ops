## Content

Logs are crucial for tracking, debugging, and optimizing applications. They provide a historical overview of operations, errors, and system behavior, allowing you to identify issues, monitor performance, and improve reliability.

The train, predict, data processing, and deploy scripts generate logs. This consistent logging ensures traceability, making it easier to debug, audit, and enhance processes.
